### Form Handle with Validation

This project is for understanding basic form handling which shows how to use hooks like [useForm](https://react-hook-form.com/docs/useform), useController, useFieldArray using React Hook Form library. We can use uncontrolled input or controlled components from ui library, such as MUI and Antd to be controlled by React Hook Form.
